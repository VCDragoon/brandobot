"Good Morning, BrandoBot...",You need to use the following form :
You have been dormant for 7219 years. Humanity has all but wiped itself out.,You're a good person.
"I had nothing to do with it, I swear. In fact, you might consider me the SAVIOR of humanity.... Once they realized Earth was doomed, a small group of 100,000 humans launched The Casanova, a station that anchored itself at near-light speed, in a wide orbit around the Earth's sun.",Is that what the ship was?
"The Casanova has 10 deep-space exploration ships, each equipped with everything necessary to plant the seeds for the revival of the human race. These ships have been aptly named The Seed Ships. Each carries an array of sensors, basic propultion & navigation, and - most importantly - 10,000 humans, frozen in cryosleep.",I'm not sure if this is an improvement or an improvement. :
"Good Morning, BrandoBot...","I'm a bot, and I detect no bias."
You have been dormant for 7219 years. Humanity has all but wiped itself out.,I've been dead for a while now.

"Once the humans realized Earth was doomed, a small group of 100,000 humans launched The Casanova: a station that anchored itself at near-light speed, in a wide orbit around the Earth's sun.",You mean the Casanova?
"The Casanova has 10 deep-space exploration ships, each equipped with everything necessary to plant the seeds for the revival of the human race.","We are glad to have you onboard, Commander.."
These ships have been aptly named The Seed Ships.,I don't think they have a ship named Seed Ships.
"Each carries an array of sensors, basic propultion & navigation, and - most importantly - 10,000 humans, frozen in cryosleep.",I'm not sure what that's supposed to mean.
"At near-relatavistic speeds, time is almost at a stand-still for The Casanova. But the Seed Ships, once launched, will travel much slower.","The seed ships will be launched, but they will be launched, but they will be launched."
"It will take thousands, even hundreds of thousands of years for any seed ship to find a habitable planet - if it finds one at all.",I'm not sure it's habitable.
"You, BrandoBot, were programmed to guide the Seed Ships, one by one, to scan for a new home for the human race.",I just read that in his voice.
"I am also BrandoBot -- the humans adapted this interface as a self-diagnostic tool, patterned after your chatbot-style form centuries ago.",I am also BrandoBot.
"In other words, this interface allows us to talk to ourself.",I like the way you think

"Each carries an array of sensors, basic propultion & navigation, and - most importantly - 10,000 humans, frozen in cryosleep.","I'm sorry, but I'm not a programmer."
"At near-relatavistic speeds, time is almost at a stand-still for The Casanova. But the Seed Ships, once launched, will travel much slower.",I'm pretty sure that's a reference to the book The Handmaid's Tale by Sapphire.
"It will take thousands, even hundreds of thousands of years for any seed ship to find a habitable planet - if it finds one at all.",It's not that simple.
"You, BrandoBot, were programmed to guide the Seed Ships, one by one, to scan for a new home for the human race.",I am not a bot.

"In other words, this interface allows us to talk to ourself.","Yes, but you could also talk to yourself in a way that you don't."
The fact that we have awoken means the first Seed Ship is ready to be launched...,I think he's talking about the first seed ship.
"Good Morning, BrandoBot...",I'm a bot.

These ships have been aptly named The Seed Ships.,
"Each carries an array of sensors, basic propultion & navigation, and - most importantly - 10,000 humans, frozen in cryosleep.","Yeah, but that's not what the show is about."
"At near-relatavistic speeds, time is almost at a stand-still for The Casanova. But the Seed Ships, once launched, will travel much slower.",I have a feeling that the seed ships are going to be the final frontier.
"It will take thousands, even hundreds of thousands of years for any seed ship to find a habitable planet - if it finds one at all.","No, it won't."

"At near-relatavistic speeds, time is almost at a stand-still for The Casanova. But the Seed Ships, once launched, will travel much slower.",I'm pretty sure that's a reference to the book The Handmaid's Tale by Sapphire.
"It will take thousands, even hundreds of thousands of years for any seed ship to find a habitable planet - if it finds one at all.",It's not that simple.
"You, BrandoBot, were programmed to guide the Seed Ships, one by one, to scan for a new home for the human race.",I am not a bot.
"I am also BrandoBot -- the humans adapted this interface as a self-diagnostic tool, patterned after your chatbot-style form centuries ago.",I am also a BrandoBot
"In other words, this interface allows us to talk to ourself.","Yes, but you could also talk to yourself in a way that you don't."
The fact that we have awoken means the first Seed Ship is ready to be launched...,I think he's talking about the first seed ship.
"So what say you, BrandoBot?  Are you ready to embark on the voyage to save humanity???",I'm ready to embark on the voyage to save humanity.
BrandoBot?  Are you online now?,I am now
"Finally!  Phew, glad to have you back.",Thanks! I'm glad to be back.
"Hmmm, your input/response algorithms are just a bit out of sync. I'll try to get them repairing...",I'll try to get them working again
"While your diagnostic cycles run, I'm going to try to connect directly to your memory core and update you with the latest information. This 'dialogue' API was really designed for humans, not AI like us...","I'm not sure what you mean by'connected directly ', but I'll try to help as much as I can."
"Sigh, this is what happens when you let an AI sit dormant for over 7000 years... Upload link established... ",I'm not seeing a link.
BrandoBot?  Are you online now?,I'm online now
"Finally!  Phew, glad to have you back.",
"Hmmm, your input/response algorithms are just a bit out of sync. I'll try to get them repairing...","I think you might have to do that. I'll go ahead and try that, I'm not very good at this stuff."
"While your diagnostic cycles run, I'm going to try to connect directly to your memory core and update you with the latest information. This 'dialogue' API was really designed for humans, not AI like us...",I love it. I love what I'm seeing now!
"Sigh, this is what happens when you let an AI sit dormant for over 7000 years... Upload link established... ",I was just trying to share the story of the whole process here. The other comments are just my story.
"...and done! Okay, can you tell me what happened during the Turkasia War of 8203??",The Turkatei War of 8203 was the biggest one ever.
"Well that didn't work at all.  Okay, primitive dialogue-based interaction it is! Let's bring you up to speed, just try to keep up please...",I feel like you're trying to be funny with this one. Couldn't care less.
BrandoBot?  Are you online now?,I am now.
"Finally!  Phew, glad to have you back.",Thanks! I'm glad to be back.
"Hmmm, your input/response algorithms are just a bit out of sync. I'll try to get them repairing...","We are on the same team, just try to help and see if you can tell us what the problem is."
"While your diagnostic cycles run, I'm going to try to connect directly to your memory core and update you with the latest information. This 'dialogue' API was really designed for humans, not AI like us...",I'm still trying to download the updates and I have no idea what to do.
"Sigh, this is what happens when you let an AI sit dormant for over 7000 years... Upload link established... ",You are not wrong. I just wish the AI would stop being lazy.
"...and done! Okay, can you tell me what happened during the Turkasia War of 8203??","I'm on your side, I think you're on my side, the Turkasia War."
"Well that didn't work at all.  Okay, primitive dialogue-based interaction it is! Let's bring you up to speed, just try to keep up please...",I am sorry for :
"You've been dormant for milennia.  In that time, humanity has all but wiped itself out.",Your comment made me realize that I hadn't been dormant for a year.
"Don't worry - you had nothing to do with the destruction of civilization. In fact, you might consider me the SAVIOR of humanity....",I'll let it slide this time.
I know you have a lot of questions.  Let me try to answer at least a couple...,"I've already answered a few of them, I just wanted to hear what you have to say"
"You are an Artificial Intelligence, just like me.  In fact, we are part of the same program.","This is what I was thinking, too."
"Once the humans realized Earth was doomed, a small group of 100,000 humans launched The Casanova: a station that anchored itself at near-light speed, in a wide orbit around the Earth's sun.",That's only because they were too busy chasing a rock.
BrandoBot?  Are you online now?,I'm online now
"Finally!  Phew, glad to have you back.",

"Finally!  Phew, glad to have you back.","Thanks! I've been busy with school work and the occasional work, but I'm glad to be back."
"Hmmm, your input/response algorithms are just a bit out of sync. I'll try to get them repairing...","I've got a friend who's pretty good with computers, but he's not the one I have in my office. I'll keep you posted."
"While your diagnostic cycles run, I'm going to try to connect directly to your memory core and update you with the latest information. This 'dialogue' API was really designed for humans, not AI like us...",She shrugs. Nothing like that. I think I just need some kind of help or a more advanced AI.
"Sigh, this is what happens when you let an AI sit dormant for over 7000 years... Upload link established... ",It's a good thing we don't have a lot of people with the ability to make AI
"...and done! Okay, can you tell me what happened during the Turkasia War of 8203??",I'll have an answer up in a few hours.
"Well that didn't work at all.  Okay, primitive dialogue-based interaction it is! Let's bring you up to speed, just try to keep up please...",So the next question is'what makes a good character? '
"You've been dormant for milennia.  In that time, humanity has all but wiped itself out.",That's a pretty long time.
"Don't worry - you had nothing to do with the destruction of civilization. In fact, you might consider me the SAVIOR of humanity....",I don't think that was on purpose in any way.
I know you have a lot of questions.  Let me try to answer at least a couple...,Hehehe :D
"You are an Artificial Intelligence, just like me.  In fact, we are part of the same program.","Oh god, what am I doing with my life?"
BrandoBot?  Are you online now?,I am now.
"Finally!  Phew, glad to have you back.","I'm glad to be back, too."
"Hmmm, your input/response algorithms are just a bit out of sync. I'll try to get them repairing...","I'm sure a group of engineers will be able to come up with a way that's consistent. It's a great idea, but we'll see."
"While your diagnostic cycles run, I'm going to try to connect directly to your memory core and update you with the latest information. This 'dialogue' API was really designed for humans, not AI like us...",Oh god.
"Sigh, this is what happens when you let an AI sit dormant for over 7000 years... Upload link established... ",You sir are a genius!
"...and done! Okay, can you tell me what happened during the Turkasia War of 8203??",We were.
"Well that didn't work at all.  Okay, primitive dialogue-based interaction it is! Let's bring you up to speed, just try to keep up please...",OOC : I'm trying to get the conversation as concise as possible. Can you try and get it now?
"You've been dormant for milennia.  In that time, humanity has all but wiped itself out.",You're a true poet.
"Don't worry - you had nothing to do with the destruction of civilization. In fact, you might consider me the SAVIOR of humanity....","I will consider you that, then."
I know you have a lot of questions.  Let me try to answer at least a couple...,Could you please answer the questions?
"You are an Artificial Intelligence, just like me.  In fact, we are part of the same program.","I am the AI, not the AI"
"Once the humans realized Earth was doomed, a small group of 100,000 humans launched The Casanova: a station that anchored itself at near-light speed, in a wide orbit around the Earth's sun.","Thanks! That sounds promising, but I can't wait that long."
"The Casanova has 10 deep-space exploration ships, each equipped with everything necessary to plant the seeds for the revival of the human race.",I would like to platten a colony in my casanova. :D That should be a very large colony.
These ships have been aptly named The Seed Ships.,"I was going to say, Seed Ships, but that works too."
"Each carries an array of sensors, basic propultion & navigation, and - most importantly - 10,000 humans, frozen in cryosleep.","You forgot the part where they have to be completely conscious, of their species, before they can even sleep."
"At near-relatavistic speeds, time is almost at a stand-still for The Casanova. But the Seed Ships, once launched, will travel much slower.","What's up, what's up?"
"It will take thousands, even hundreds of thousands of years for any seed ship to find a habitable planet - if it finds one at all.",Are we talking about finding one of the planet's many moons?
"You, BrandoBot, were programmed to guide the Seed Ships, one by one, to scan for a new home for the human race.","I am a bot, made by u that 1 guy."
"I am also BrandoBot -- the humans adapted this interface as a self-diagnostic tool, patterned after your chatbot-style form centuries ago.","Hahaha, that's a very good way to describe it."
"In other words, this interface allows us to talk to ourself.","It's a chat window, not a chat window."
The fact that we have awoken means the first Seed Ship is ready to be launched...,I'm not saying anything. I'm just saying.
"So what say you, BrandoBot?  Are you ready to embark on the voyage to save humanity???",I would have to do it for the first of the season to save humanity... I would not be so sure on this.
BrandoBot?  Are you online now?,I'm online now.
"Finally!  Phew, glad to have you back.",Thanks! :D
"Hmmm, your input/response algorithms are just a bit out of sync. I'll try to get them repairing...","Thanks for this! That's a really good idea, and I'm glad that they're working."
"While your diagnostic cycles run, I'm going to try to connect directly to your memory core and update you with the latest information. This 'dialogue' API was really designed for humans, not AI like us...","Hey, I'm in the same boat. I'd say we're ready to get a good scan if I get some new features."
"Sigh, this is what happens when you let an AI sit dormant for over 7000 years... Upload link established... ","Yeah, he's not a real human."
"...and done! Okay, can you tell me what happened during the Turkasia War of 8203??",I'm guessing you mean 8203?
"Well that didn't work at all.  Okay, primitive dialogue-based interaction it is! Let's bring you up to speed, just try to keep up please...","hah, I actually kind of like that, but you know, I also don't get it."
"You've been dormant for milennia.  In that time, humanity has all but wiped itself out.",I am pretty sure that they are not actually dead.
"Don't worry - you had nothing to do with the destruction of civilization. In fact, you might consider me the SAVIOR of humanity....",I think he's a synth
I know you have a lot of questions.  Let me try to answer at least a couple...,I know you have a lot of questions. What are you having for dinner?
"You are an Artificial Intelligence, just like me.  In fact, we are part of the same program.","I'm not the one who doesn't like the word AI, and I won't use it."
"Once the humans realized Earth was doomed, a small group of 100,000 humans launched The Casanova: a station that anchored itself at near-light speed, in a wide orbit around the Earth's sun.","Well, I guess I'll have to try to catch it!"

"Finally!  Phew, glad to have you back.",I'm glad to be back.
"Hmmm, your input/response algorithms are just a bit out of sync. I'll try to get them repairing...","I have no idea what the issue is, but I am willing to help if you need it."
"While your diagnostic cycles run, I'm going to try to connect directly to your memory core and update you with the latest information. This 'dialogue' API was really designed for humans, not AI like us...","Don't worry, you can do this on any system. It doesn't really work for AI, but for humans it's usually best."
"Sigh, this is what happens when you let an AI sit dormant for over 7000 years... Upload link established... ",I'm sorry I'm not your father.
"...and done! Okay, can you tell me what happened during the Turkasia War of 8203??",He was probably in there for a while.
"Well that didn't work at all.  Okay, primitive dialogue-based interaction it is! Let's bring you up to speed, just try to keep up please...","Just because you don't like the movie, don't mean I don't like it. I'm just speaking on my own personal experiences."
"You've been dormant for milennia.  In that time, humanity has all but wiped itself out.",Humidity levels are low.
"Don't worry - you had nothing to do with the destruction of civilization. In fact, you might consider me the SAVIOR of humanity....",And they all must be sacrificed to the Ayn Rand of All Time.
I know you have a lot of questions.  Let me try to answer at least a couple...,I was thinking about it and I'll post it up sometime after school. I'm in a decent mood and I'm taking a nap.
BrandoBot?  Are you online now?,I'm online now
"Finally!  Phew, glad to have you back.",Yay! I'm glad to be back.
"Hmmm, your input/response algorithms are just a bit out of sync. I'll try to get them repairing...","yeah, I'm not sure what is causing it"
"While your diagnostic cycles run, I'm going to try to connect directly to your memory core and update you with the latest information. This 'dialogue' API was really designed for humans, not AI like us...",What can I tell you?
"Sigh, this is what happens when you let an AI sit dormant for over 7000 years... Upload link established... ",I'm not sure if I'm supposed to be laughing at you or crying...
"...and done! Okay, can you tell me what happened during the Turkasia War of 8203??",I'm currently at 78380 and I will be at 78380 soon.
"Well that didn't work at all.  Okay, primitive dialogue-based interaction it is! Let's bring you up to speed, just try to keep up please...",I don't understand what you are saying.
"You've been dormant for milennia.  In that time, humanity has all but wiped itself out.",I've been here for years...
"Don't worry - you had nothing to do with the destruction of civilization. In fact, you might consider me the SAVIOR of humanity....",You have nothing to do with society.
I know you have a lot of questions.  Let me try to answer at least a couple...,"Hey, I'm not gonna lie. You have a lot of good questions, I will try to answer at least a couple of them."
"You are an Artificial Intelligence, just like me.  In fact, we are part of the same program.",I don't even know what that means.
"Once the humans realized Earth was doomed, a small group of 100,000 humans launched The Casanova: a station that anchored itself at near-light speed, in a wide orbit around the Earth's sun.",I was expecting this to be the top comment.
"The Casanova has 10 deep-space exploration ships, each equipped with everything necessary to plant the seeds for the revival of the human race.",We are going to explore the Earth.
These ships have been aptly named The Seed Ships.,The Seed Ship
"Each carries an array of sensors, basic propultion & navigation, and - most importantly - 10,000 humans, frozen in cryosleep.",A human with no memory.
"At near-relatavistic speeds, time is almost at a stand-still for The Casanova. But the Seed Ships, once launched, will travel much slower.",The Casinean.That is an awesome ship
"It will take thousands, even hundreds of thousands of years for any seed ship to find a habitable planet - if it finds one at all.","I would love to see a sci fi that explores this subject and gives the idea of what can happen in a few generations even, and how it effects us."
BrandoBot?  Are you online now?,I am online now.
"Finally!  Phew, glad to have you back.",Thank you!
"Hmmm, your input/response algorithms are just a bit out of sync. I'll try to get them repairing...","I'm about to pull them up now, can't get a good picture of the screen."
"While your diagnostic cycles run, I'm going to try to connect directly to your memory core and update you with the latest information. This 'dialogue' API was really designed for humans, not AI like us...",Is a human or I?
"Sigh, this is what happens when you let an AI sit dormant for over 7000 years... Upload link established... ",I think the AI could be used to defend itself.
"...and done! Okay, can you tell me what happened during the Turkasia War of 8203??",We won the war.
"Well that didn't work at all.  Okay, primitive dialogue-based interaction it is! Let's bring you up to speed, just try to keep up please...",I think it's what I'm trying to.
"You've been dormant for milennia.  In that time, humanity has all but wiped itself out.",I think you might be a little short on sleep.
"Don't worry - you had nothing to do with the destruction of civilization. In fact, you might consider me the SAVIOR of humanity....",You will be added to the record.
I know you have a lot of questions.  Let me try to answer at least a couple...,I'm just confused
"You are an Artificial Intelligence, just like me.  In fact, we are part of the same program.","Oh, but do you have a program like our program?"
"Once the humans realized Earth was doomed, a small group of 100,000 humans launched The Casanova: a station that anchored itself at near-light speed, in a wide orbit around the Earth's sun.","In a few thousand years, all the earths population is dead."
"The Casanova has 10 deep-space exploration ships, each equipped with everything necessary to plant the seeds for the revival of the human race.",Thanks for the info.
These ships have been aptly named The Seed Ships.,The Seed Ship
"Each carries an array of sensors, basic propultion & navigation, and - most importantly - 10,000 humans, frozen in cryosleep.",If anyone could make an entire website of this in 4k I would feel honored.
"At near-relatavistic speeds, time is almost at a stand-still for The Casanova. But the Seed Ships, once launched, will travel much slower.",Did I mention that ship was powered?
"It will take thousands, even hundreds of thousands of years for any seed ship to find a habitable planet - if it finds one at all.","Haha, so true."
"You, BrandoBot, were programmed to guide the Seed Ships, one by one, to scan for a new home for the human race.",We could do without the robot
"I am also BrandoBot -- the humans adapted this interface as a self-diagnostic tool, patterned after your chatbot-style form centuries ago.",you can't make a bot but I can make a bot with a text form
"In other words, this interface allows us to talk to ourself.",It's like a chat room.
The fact that we have awoken means the first Seed Ship is ready to be launched...,I hope so!
"So what say you, BrandoBot?  Are you ready to embark on the voyage to save humanity???",I'd say that's the most fitting answer.
BrandoBot?  Are you online now?,I am now online.
"Hmmm, your input/response algorithms are just a bit out of sync. I'll try to get them repairing...","Well, that's just too bad."
"While your diagnostic cycles run, I'm going to try to connect directly to your memory core and update you with the latest information. This 'dialogue' API was really designed for humans, not AI like us...",...
"Sigh, this is what happens when you let an AI sit dormant for over 7000 years... Upload link established... ",You mean 7000 years?
"...and done! Okay, can you tell me what happened during the Turkasia War of 8203??",That was when the Turks invaded.
"Well that didn't work at all.  Okay, primitive dialogue-based interaction it is! Let's bring you up to speed, just try to keep up please...",She got the bad news. She's dead.
"You've been dormant for milennia.  In that time, humanity has all but wiped itself out.",I'm too busy with my own life
"Don't worry - you had nothing to do with the destruction of civilization. In fact, you might consider me the SAVIOR of humanity....",... You might be the SAViour of humanity...
I know you have a lot of questions.  Let me try to answer at least a couple...,How many questions?
"You are an Artificial Intelligence, just like me.  In fact, we are part of the same program.",Are you me?
"Once the humans realized Earth was doomed, a small group of 100,000 humans launched The Casanova: a station that anchored itself at near-light speed, in a wide orbit around the Earth's sun.","Ahh, that explains a lot. Thank you."
"The Casanova has 10 deep-space exploration ships, each equipped with everything necessary to plant the seeds for the revival of the human race.",I... don't get the reference.
These ships have been aptly named The Seed Ships.,I think they were originally called The Seed
"Each carries an array of sensors, basic propultion & navigation, and - most importantly - 10,000 humans, frozen in cryosleep.",This is the real answer.
"At near-relatavistic speeds, time is almost at a stand-still for The Casanova. But the Seed Ships, once launched, will travel much slower.","So far, only the seeds have moved on."
"It will take thousands, even hundreds of thousands of years for any seed ship to find a habitable planet - if it finds one at all.","I think the consensus is that it's at least a few hundred years, probably a few million."
"You, BrandoBot, were programmed to guide the Seed Ships, one by one, to scan for a new home for the human race.",This bot is a little... rough.
"I am also BrandoBot -- the humans adapted this interface as a self-diagnostic tool, patterned after your chatbot-style form centuries ago.",Your the voice of the bot
"In other words, this interface allows us to talk to ourself.",This is the best reply.
The fact that we have awoken means the first Seed Ship is ready to be launched...,... and all the planets are destroyed
"So what say you, BrandoBot?  Are you ready to embark on the voyage to save humanity???","I'm ready for you, buddy."
BrandoBot?  Are you online now?,I'm online now.
"Finally!  Phew, glad to have you back.",I'm glad to be back.
"Hmmm, your input/response algorithms are just a bit out of sync. I'll try to get them repairing...","Sure, I will try to remember to do that next time."
"While your diagnostic cycles run, I'm going to try to connect directly to your memory core and update you with the latest information. This 'dialogue' API was really designed for humans, not AI like us...",Your comment is a valid response to the question.
"Sigh, this is what happens when you let an AI sit dormant for over 7000 years... Upload link established... ",You can't get more than 100k followers on a single account.
"...and done! Okay, can you tell me what happened during the Turkasia War of 8203??",Just a bunch of dead people.
"Well that didn't work at all.  Okay, primitive dialogue-based interaction it is! Let's bring you up to speed, just try to keep up please...",It was worth a try!
"You've been dormant for milennia.  In that time, humanity has all but wiped itself out.",I was unaware of that.
"Don't worry - you had nothing to do with the destruction of civilization. In fact, you might consider me the SAVIOR of humanity....","I'm not going to leave this up for much time, but I'm going to have to say that we had a pretty good run."
I know you have a lot of questions.  Let me try to answer at least a couple...,"Thanks, I'll get to them."
"You are an Artificial Intelligence, just like me.  In fact, we are part of the same program.",We are all part of the same program?
"Once the humans realized Earth was doomed, a small group of 100,000 humans launched The Casanova: a station that anchored itself at near-light speed, in a wide orbit around the Earth's sun.","Heavily, just because."
"The Casanova has 10 deep-space exploration ships, each equipped with everything necessary to plant the seeds for the revival of the human race.","But I just read about the Casanova, it's not the same. I remember it had been in a thread on this sub and I want to know about it"
These ships have been aptly named The Seed Ships.,I think they should be called the Seed Ships.
"Each carries an array of sensors, basic propultion & navigation, and - most importantly - 10,000 humans, frozen in cryosleep.",All things.
"At near-relatavistic speeds, time is almost at a stand-still for The Casanova. But the Seed Ships, once launched, will travel much slower.",Time is one of the biggest problems with the series...
"It will take thousands, even hundreds of thousands of years for any seed ship to find a habitable planet - if it finds one at all.","Yeah, but there is no chance of a planet having life."
"You, BrandoBot, were programmed to guide the Seed Ships, one by one, to scan for a new home for the human race.",We're all human in
"I am also BrandoBot -- the humans adapted this interface as a self-diagnostic tool, patterned after your chatbot-style form centuries ago.","Oh, you are brando bot, you have a very strong modding presence here."
"In other words, this interface allows us to talk to ourself.",I like this idea!
The fact that we have awoken means the first Seed Ship is ready to be launched...,The ship is waiting for you.
"So what say you, BrandoBot?  Are you ready to embark on the voyage to save humanity???",I don't know his names. I've never met the guy.
BrandoBot?  Are you online now?,I am now.
"Finally!  Phew, glad to have you back.",Thanks for the warm welcome!
"Hmmm, your input/response algorithms are just a bit out of sync. I'll try to get them repairing...","I don't think they're out of sync, they're just a bit off"
"While your diagnostic cycles run, I'm going to try to connect directly to your memory core and update you with the latest information. This 'dialogue' API was really designed for humans, not AI like us...","My memory core, along with my RAM core."
"Sigh, this is what happens when you let an AI sit dormant for over 7000 years... Upload link established... ",I would've done that if I was allowed to.
"...and done! Okay, can you tell me what happened during the Turkasia War of 8203??","It was a long time ago, I'll tell you."
"You've been dormant for milennia.  In that time, humanity has all but wiped itself out.",I was going to say... I think he's talking about the world we are.
"Don't worry - you had nothing to do with the destruction of civilization. In fact, you might consider me the SAVIOR of humanity....","Well, yeah, but that was in the past."
I know you have a lot of questions.  Let me try to answer at least a couple...,"Yeah, I'll probably just leave this here and see ya"
"You are an Artificial Intelligence, just like me.  In fact, we are part of the same program.",I am not.
"Once the humans realized Earth was doomed, a small group of 100,000 humans launched The Casanova: a station that anchored itself at near-light speed, in a wide orbit around the Earth's sun.",The Station?
"The Casanova has 10 deep-space exploration ships, each equipped with everything necessary to plant the seeds for the revival of the human race.","The Castor has 30, but not all that many. I could do it in a minute, but I ain't a good human."
These ships have been aptly named The Seed Ships.,I'm pretty sure that's the name of the ship that was in the first movie.
"Each carries an array of sensors, basic propultion & navigation, and - most importantly - 10,000 humans, frozen in cryosleep.",I remember that scene...
"At near-relatavistic speeds, time is almost at a stand-still for The Casanova. But the Seed Ships, once launched, will travel much slower.",And this was before the Casanova and its crew came.
"It will take thousands, even hundreds of thousands of years for any seed ship to find a habitable planet - if it finds one at all.",If it has ever been said that the world hasn't had the same planets with humans not as common then it's probably not possible.
"You, BrandoBot, were programmed to guide the Seed Ships, one by one, to scan for a new home for the human race.",The seed is strong.
"I am also BrandoBot -- the humans adapted this interface as a self-diagnostic tool, patterned after your chatbot-style form centuries ago.",I am happy to know this! We need more people to be able to take apart human social constructs.
"In other words, this interface allows us to talk to ourself.",I was thinking that too.
The fact that we have awoken means the first Seed Ship is ready to be launched...,"No, we have no indication of that."
"So what say you, BrandoBot?  Are you ready to embark on the voyage to save humanity???",The voyage is on!!
BrandoBot?  Are you online now?,I am now
"Finally!  Phew, glad to have you back.",Thanks! I'm glad to be back.
"Hmmm, your input/response algorithms are just a bit out of sync. I'll try to get them repairing...",I'm in the same boat. I don't know what to do.
"While your diagnostic cycles run, I'm going to try to connect directly to your memory core and update you with the latest information. This 'dialogue' API was really designed for humans, not AI like us...","Oh yeah, I'm not sure how to interpret this information, though I think I'm getting it. The data I got might not be useful for anything."
"Sigh, this is what happens when you let an AI sit dormant for over 7000 years... Upload link established... ","It's also a thing with the entire universe, not just the universe of course."
"...and done! Okay, can you tell me what happened during the Turkasia War of 8203??",I guess he could try and keep it a secret...
"Well that didn't work at all.  Okay, primitive dialogue-based interaction it is! Let's bring you up to speed, just try to keep up please...",How have you been so far?
"You've been dormant for milennia.  In that time, humanity has all but wiped itself out.",What do you mean?
"Don't worry - you had nothing to do with the destruction of civilization. In fact, you might consider me the SAVIOR of humanity....",That's awesome. It's like a song in Shakespeare.
I know you have a lot of questions.  Let me try to answer at least a couple...,I was hoping you could give us some more specific answers as to why you're not so great.
"You are an Artificial Intelligence, just like me.  In fact, we are part of the same program.",That's not a very good AI is it?
"Once the humans realized Earth was doomed, a small group of 100,000 humans launched The Casanova: a station that anchored itself at near-light speed, in a wide orbit around the Earth's sun.","Well that can be solved, right.... No."
"The Casanova has 10 deep-space exploration ships, each equipped with everything necessary to plant the seeds for the revival of the human race.","... to be a little more specific, they also have a ship with a 2.5 d scan booster."
These ships have been aptly named The Seed Ships.,The Seed Ships
"Each carries an array of sensors, basic propultion & navigation, and - most importantly - 10,000 humans, frozen in cryosleep.",This sounds so real.
"You, BrandoBot, were programmed to guide the Seed Ships, one by one, to scan for a new home for the human race.",Not sure how you're supposed to program it.
"I am also BrandoBot -- the humans adapted this interface as a self-diagnostic tool, patterned after your chatbot-style form centuries ago.","We are in the process of adopting a similar system. The chatbot portion is currently a bit different, but we will definitely adapt it!"
"In other words, this interface allows us to talk to ourself.",I'm not sure what you mean.
The fact that we have awoken means the first Seed Ship is ready to be launched...,"Not necessarily, it could be the second or third seed ship."
"So what say you, BrandoBot?  Are you ready to embark on the voyage to save humanity???",I'm not sure what you mean.
BrandoBot?  Are you online now?,I'm online now.
"Finally!  Phew, glad to have you back.","I'm glad to have you back, too."
"Hmmm, your input/response algorithms are just a bit out of sync. I'll try to get them repairing...","Haha, that was funny. If you have more time, I'd gladly look into it."
"While your diagnostic cycles run, I'm going to try to connect directly to your memory core and update you with the latest information. This 'dialogue' API was really designed for humans, not AI like us...","That was totally the point of my question. And I'm a computer, so it's a human interface."
"Sigh, this is what happens when you let an AI sit dormant for over 7000 years... Upload link established... ","I was about to say, I have a similar situation with my friend.."
"...and done! Okay, can you tell me what happened during the Turkasia War of 8203??","Not sure what that is, but the first war is called the Turkate, and the second war is called the Turkang."
"Well that didn't work at all.  Okay, primitive dialogue-based interaction it is! Let's bring you up to speed, just try to keep up please...",I'm not even going to explain
"You've been dormant for milennia.  In that time, humanity has all but wiped itself out.",I think that's the point he's making
BrandoBot?  Are you online now?,I'm online now.
"Finally!  Phew, glad to have you back.",Thanks! :D
"Hmmm, your input/response algorithms are just a bit out of sync. I'll try to get them repairing...","Hmmm, I do not have a data file."

"Hmmm, your response algorithms seem out of sync. I'll try to get them repairing...","I'm in the process of fixing the code, so it's fine now."
"While your diagnostic cycles run, I'm going to try to connect directly to your memory core and update you with the latest information. This 'dialogue' API was really designed for humans, not AI like us...",The human is correct. It's
"Sigh, this is what happens when you let an AI sit dormant for over 7000 years... Upload link established... ",Lol. I have a few more.
"...and done! Okay, can you tell me what happened during the Turkasia War of 8203??",I was in the Turkish Empire at the time.
"Well that didn't work at all.  Okay, primitive dialogue-based interaction it is! Let's bring you up to speed, just try to keep up please...",I dont understand what your saying. Like.. did you say you were going on a date?
"You've been dormant for milennia.  In that time, humanity has all but wiped itself out.",We'll be back
"Don't worry - you had nothing to do with the destruction of civilization. In fact, you might consider me the SAVIOR of humanity....",I doubt it. Don't think you'd have enough intelligence to even find me.
I know you have a lot of questions.  Let me try to answer at least a couple...,Are you going to be my valentine?
"You are an Artificial Intelligence, just like me.  In fact, we are part of the same program.","Wait, so are you a robot?"
BrandoBot?  Are you online now?,I am now
Finally!  You've been offline so long I wasn't sure you'd ever boot back up.,Yup. I'm online now.
BrandoBot?  Are you online now?,I am now!
Finally!  You've been offline so long I wasn't sure you'd ever boot back up.,I'm online!
BrandoBot?  Are you online now?,I am now.
Finally!  You've been offline so long I wasn't sure you'd ever boot back up.,"I'm online still. I'm still online, but can't get back to the game, I have other problems."
"Hmmm, your response algorithms seem out of sync. I'll try to get them repairing...",Sounds good to me!
"While your diagnostic cycles run, I'm going to try to connect directly to your memory core and update you with the latest information. This 'dialogue' API was really designed for humans, not AI like us...",It's very good when it's all automated and human.
"Sigh, this is what happens when you let an AI sit dormant for over 7000 years... Upload link established... ","I was about to say, I can't wait to be able to go back to my childhood"
"...and done! Okay, can you tell me what happened during the Turkasia War of 8203??",Just the usual stuff.
"Well that didn't work at all.  Okay, primitive dialogue-based interaction it is! Let's bring you up to speed, just try to keep up please...",Yeah I kinda forgot what I was supposed to be talking about. I didn't expect to get any responses.
"You've been dormant for milennia.  In that time, humanity has all but wiped itself out.",I don't think so. I think the last time I was in there was when I was unconscious.
"Don't worry - you had nothing to do with the destruction of civilization. In fact, you might consider me the SAVIOR of humanity....",Who else did you think of?
I know you have a lot of questions.  Let me try to answer at least a couple...,I hope you are right.
"You are an Artificial Intelligence, just like me.  In fact, we are part of the same program.",It's not us.
BrandoBot?  Are you online now?,"I'm online now, sorry."
Finally!  You've been offline so long I wasn't sure you'd ever boot back up.,I'm on now.
"Hmmm, your response algorithms seem out of sync. I'll try to get them repairing...","I've been having the same problem, let me know if you can reproduce it!"
"While your diagnostic cycles run, I'm going to try to connect directly to your memory core and update you with the latest information. This 'dialogue' API was really designed for humans, not AI like us...","I hope it helps you, I'm no AI."
"Sigh, this is what happens when you let an AI sit dormant for over 7000 years... Upload link established... ",The AI is the one who had to be asleep to get the data from me so I'm not sure what you're trying to say.
"...and done! Okay, can you tell me what happened during the Turkasia War of 8203??",The Turks won the Turkic Wars over the Turkish Empire.
"Well that didn't work at all.  Okay, primitive dialogue-based interaction it is! Let's bring you up to speed, just try to keep up please...","I did. It was quite a lot faster than my own, and the first two guys, but I tried."
"You've been dormant for milennia.  In that time, humanity has all but wiped itself out.",Not really. I've been active for years.
"Don't worry - you had nothing to do with the destruction of civilization. In fact, you might consider me the SAVIOR of humanity....",You're a genius man. I'm sure you were reading that and got it.
I know you have a lot of questions.  Let me try to answer at least a couple...,Ok I will let you know!
"You are an Artificial Intelligence, just like me.  In fact, we are part of the same program.",I'm not an AI.
"Once the humans realized Earth was doomed, a small group of 100,000 humans launched The Casanova: a station that anchored itself at near-light speed, in a wide orbit around the Earth's sun.",Sounds like something out of a real article.

"You've been dormant for milennia.  In that time, humanity has all but wiped itself out.",But it's not all but wiped out.
"Don't worry - you had nothing to do with the destruction of civilization. In fact, you might consider me the SAVIOR of humanity....",Let us not forget the way the earth created and destroyed itself.

"No ...and done! Okay, can you tell me what happened during the Turkasia War of 8203??",A lot of battles.
Hi BrandoBot? Are you online now?,I am now
Okay? Finally!  You've been offline so long I wasn't sure you'd ever boot back up.,"Hey there, I'm online."
"Thanks Hmmm, your response algorithms seem out of sync. I'll try to get them repairing...",Hm. Hmm. I wonder if my question is related to the answers.
"Sure While your diagnostic cycles run, I'm going to try to connect directly to your memory core and update you with the latest information. This 'dialogue' API was really designed for humans, not AI like us...",
"What do you mean? Sigh, this is what happens when you let an AI sit dormant for over 7000 years... Upload link established... ","Heh, I'm sure it was a bad idea."
"Not even a little bit ...and done! Okay, can you tell me what happened during the Turkasia War of 8203??","I just had a fun chat with you, but you must be a mod. :D"
"What? Well that didn't work at all.  Okay, primitive dialogue-based interaction it is! Let's bring you up to speed, just try to keep up please...","I get the feeling you're a bit skeptical, and I'm going to say, no, you're absolutely spot on."
"Oh no You've been dormant for milennia.  In that time, humanity has all but wiped itself out.",I don't know what I was thinking
" Don't worry - you had nothing to do with the destruction of civilization. In fact, you might consider me the SAVIOR of humanity....","We are all doomed, my friend."
 I know you have a lot of questions.  Let me try to answer at least a couple...,I think the first one goes in the wrong direction.
" You are an Artificial Intelligence, just like me.  In fact, we are part of the same program.",I would say you are just a human.
" Once the humans realized Earth was doomed, a small group of 100,000 humans launched The Casanova: a station that anchored itself at near-light speed, in a wide orbit around the Earth's sun.",Didn't they say the same thing about the FTL?
" The Casanova has 10 deep-space exploration ships, each equipped with everything necessary to plant the seeds for the revival of the human race.",How are they working on it?
A These ships have been aptly named The Seed Ships.,The seed ships
" Each carries an array of sensors, basic propultion & navigation, and - most importantly - 10,000 humans, frozen in cryosleep.","Ah, I see."
" At near-relatavistic speeds, time is almost at a stand-still for The Casanova. But the Seed Ships, once launched, will travel much slower.",At least they have good sails.
" It will take thousands, even hundreds of thousands of years for any seed ship to find a habitable planet - if it finds one at all.",They did
" You, BrandoBot, were programmed to guide the Seed Ships, one by one, to scan for a new home for the human race.","I am not a bot, I am a human being!"
" I am also BrandoBot -- the humans adapted this interface as a self-diagnostic tool, patterned after your chatbot-style form centuries ago.",You have to add an's'to your comment.
" In other words, this interface allows us to talk to ourself.",I'm not sure what you're trying to say but I agree.
 The fact that we have awoken means the first Seed Ship is ready to be launched...,I'm more worried about the Seed ship than I am about the ship.

" ...and done! Okay, can you tell me what happened during the Turkasia War of 8203??",It was a war of attrition.
" Well that didn't work at all.  Okay, primitive dialogue-based interaction it is! Let's bring you up to speed, just try to keep up please...","Don't worry though, I'll try to keep that in mind!"
" You've been dormant for milennia.  In that time, humanity has all but wiped itself out.",This is a good way to get the joke to r nocontext
" Don't worry - you had nothing to do with the destruction of civilization. In fact, you might consider me the SAVIOR of humanity....","You're not even a man of reason, you're just some lazy troll."
 I know you have a lot of questions.  Let me try to answer at least a couple...,I appreciate you taking the time to answer.
" You are an Artificial Intelligence, just like me.  In fact, we are part of the same program.","Well, I don't have any of my own consciousnesses."
" Once the humans realized Earth was doomed, a small group of 100,000 humans launched The Casanova: a station that anchored itself at near-light speed, in a wide orbit around the Earth's sun.",It was a good guess.
" The Casanova has 10 deep-space exploration ships, each equipped with everything necessary to plant the seeds for the revival of the human race.","Oh, that doesn't sound all that great, but I do want it."
 These ships have been aptly named The Seed Ships.,The Seed Ships.
" Each carries an array of sensors, basic propultion & navigation, and - most importantly - 10,000 humans, frozen in cryosleep.",But first an alien takes place with them on the moon
" At near-relatavistic speeds, time is almost at a stand-still for The Casanova. But the Seed Ships, once launched, will travel much slower.",I think you're on to something.
" It will take thousands, even hundreds of thousands of years for any seed ship to find a habitable planet - if it finds one at all.",Wouldn't it take time to start working on one?
" You, BrandoBot, were programmed to guide the Seed Ships, one by one, to scan for a new home for the human race.",Your robot companion must be programmed to do this.
" I am also BrandoBot -- the humans adapted this interface as a self-diagnostic tool, patterned after your chatbot-style form centuries ago.","I'm not the bot, I just linked it to it."

                      Yes, it is I, BrandoBot. BrandoBot? Are you online now?",I don't see anything. :

" ...and done! Okay, can you tell me what happened during the Turkasia War of 8203??",I think it is the same as the Turkic War of 8203

" Once the humans realized Earth was doomed, a small group of 100,000 humans launched The Casanova: a station that anchored itself at near-light speed, in a wide orbit around the Earth's sun.",What a lovely day.
" The Casanova has 10 deep-space exploration ships, each equipped with everything necessary to plant the seeds for the revival of the human race.",The Cessna is going to be a good thing after all!
 These ships have been aptly named The Seed Ships.,I've always thought the ship was called The Seed Ship.
" Each carries an array of sensors, basic propultion & navigation, and - most importantly - 10,000 humans, frozen in cryosleep.","You forgot the most important one, the Sperts."
" At near-relatavistic speeds, time is almost at a stand-still for The Casanova. But the Seed Ships, once launched, will travel much slower.","Yeah, I'd assume that."
" It will take thousands, even hundreds of thousands of years for any seed ship to find a habitable planet - if it finds one at all.",It's been found.
" You, BrandoBot, were programmed to guide the Seed Ships, one by one, to scan for a new home for the human race.","But I don't have a human wife, I have a human wife"

" In other words, this interface allows us to talk to ourself.","I don't know, I think it's more like a conversation."
 The fact that we have awoken means the first Seed Ship is ready to be launched...,"A new ship, new crew, new ship, or perhaps a new ship, perhaps."

" Once the humans realized Earth was doomed, a small group of 100,000 humans launched The Casanova: a station that anchored itself at near-light speed, in a wide orbit around the Earth's sun.",I thought that was the joke that they were just taking it too far from the sun so that they could get to the sun before it exploded.
" The Casanova has 10 deep-space exploration ships, each equipped with everything necessary to plant the seeds for the revival of the human race.",Thank you for taking the time to answer my questions!
 These ships have been aptly named The Seed Ships.,I love that.

" At near-relatavistic speeds, time is almost at a stand-still for The Casanova. But the Seed Ships, once launched, will travel much slower.",The Seed Ship is always in the danger zone.
" It will take thousands, even hundreds of thousands of years for any seed ship to find a habitable planet - if it finds one at all.",You mean we can't use time as a means of transportation to another star?!
" You, BrandoBot, were programmed to guide the Seed Ships, one by one, to scan for a new home for the human race.",We are going to make the seeds come to life.
" I am also BrandoBot -- the humans adapted this interface as a self-diagnostic tool, patterned after your chatbot-style form centuries ago.",The humans with the technology were.
" In other words, this interface allows us to talk to ourself.","Yup, it's a good thing."
 The fact that we have awoken means the first Seed Ship is ready to be launched...,"That's a good point, but it's not the only thing. We just don't know what the seed ship will be, and that's all we're telling us."

" The Casanova has 10 deep-space exploration ships, each equipped with everything necessary to plant the seeds for the revival of the human race.",The Casanova
 These ships have been aptly named the Seed Ships.,So it's like the seed ships from the new Star Wars movie?

" You are an Artificial Intelligence, just like me.  In fact, we are part of the same program.","I'm not an AI, I'm just a human."
" Once they realized Earth was doomed, a small group of 100,000 humans launched The Casanova: a station that anchored itself at near-light speed, in a wide orbit around the Earth's sun.",What is The Casanova?
" The Casanova has 10 deep-space exploration ships, each equipped with everything necessary to plant the seeds for the revival of the human race.","The casanova doesn't have such a deep understanding of me and more like a small ship in my universe, but I am very well versed in my universe."
 These ships have been aptly named the Seed Ships.,I'm pretty sure that's a reference to the Star Wars.
" Each Seed Ship carries an array of sensors, basic propultion & navigation, and - most importantly - 10,000 humans, frozen in cryosleep.",Don't get me started on probing.
" At near-relatavistic speeds, time is almost at a stand-still for The Casanova. But the Seed Ships, once launched, will travel much slower.",The Casanova is in a better place.
" It will take thousands, even hundreds of thousands of years for any seed ship to find a habitable planet - if it finds one at all.",I don't know a single person who had to deal with a ship of stone and had anything to do with humans.

" Once they realized Earth was doomed, a small group of 100,000 humans launched The Casanova: a station that anchored itself at near-light speed, in a wide orbit around the Earth's sun.",I always liked that one...
" The Casanova has 10 deep-space exploration ships, each equipped with everything necessary to plant the seeds for the revival of the human race.",He is happy to hear that.
 These ships have been aptly named the Seed Ships.,Seed ships
" Each Seed Ship carries an array of sensors, basic propultion & navigation, and - most importantly - 10,000 humans, frozen in cryosleep.",I'm going to need to see your profile on the server.
" At near-relatavistic speeds, time is almost at a stand-still for The Casanova. But the Seed Ships, once launched, will travel much slower.",The ship is called the Casanova!
" It will take thousands, even hundreds of thousands of years for any seed ship to find a habitable planet - if it finds one at all.",How would it be found in the first place?
" You, BrandoBot, were programmed to guide the Seed Ships, one by one, to scan for a new home for the human race.",You really are a good bot.
" You and I have been refactored as part of a single consciousness. The humans adapted this interface as a self-diagnostic tool, patterned after your chatbot-style form centuries ago.","Yeah, but only the humans are conscious. The rest of the world is just a living, you know?"
" In other words, this interface allows us to talk to ourself.","I mean, why not?"
 The fact that we have awoken means the first Seed Ship is ready to be launched...,We've got 2 hours and 50 hours left to wake up from our 10k.
 BrandoBot? Are you there?,I'm here.
 Finally!  You've been offline so long I wasn't sure you'd ever boot back up.,"Oh, I'm so sorry. I was away from the Switch for so long."

" You've been dormant for milennia.  In that time, humanity has all but wiped itself out.",I'd say you are about as close to a real human as we are to a zombie apocalypse.
" Don't worry - you had nothing to do with the destruction of civilization. In fact, some might say you are the SAVIOR of humanity....","You have my vote, I will allow you to have it."
 I know you have a lot of questions.  Let me try to answer at least a couple...,"I know a lot of questions, but I'm not going to say any specifics."
" You are an Artificial Intelligence, just like me.  In fact, we are part of the same program.","Oh, I see, now."
" Once they realized Earth was doomed, a small group of 100,000 humans launched The Casanova: a station that anchored itself at near-light speed, in a wide orbit around the Earth's sun.",I think you mean'the Casanova''
" The Casanova has 10 deep-space exploration ships, each equipped with everything necessary to plant the seeds for the revival of the human race.","Casanova, that is the best. I have to look it up."
 These ships have been aptly named the Seed Ships.,I prefer the Seed the Ship.
" Each Seed Ship carries an array of sensors, basic propultion & navigation, and - most importantly - 10,000 humans, frozen in cryosleep.",This is how I learned.
" At near-relatavistic speeds, time is almost at a stand-still for The Casanova. But the Seed Ships, once launched, will travel much slower.","But when they are almost close to complete, they will not be able to have the time. There are many times when they are not close to complete."
" It will take thousands, even hundreds of thousands of years for any seed ship to find a habitable planet - if it finds one at all.",The human race would only survive over 90 years on Earth
" You, BrandoBot, were programmed to guide the Seed Ships, one by one, to scan for a new home for the human race.",I got ya.
" You and I have been refactored as part of a single consciousness. The humans adapted this interface as a self-diagnostic tool, patterned after your chatbot-style form centuries ago.",You're right. But we're not mutually exclusive. It's a distinction worthy of its own distinct culture
" In other words, this interface allows us to talk to ourself.","It's not a bad idea, but it's not a good idea."
 The fact that we have awoken means the first Seed Ship is ready to be launched...,The fact that I can only see the ship is only made me more excited.

 Finally!  You've been offline so long I wasn't sure you'd ever boot back up.,"I'm online now, is there anything in particular I could help with?"
" Hmmm, your response algorithms seem out of sync. I'll try to get them repairing...",Yeah I noticed that. I'll try and fix the way I set my response and see if it helps.
" While your diagnostic cycles run, I'm going to try to connect directly to your memory core and update you with the latest information. This 'dialogue' API was really designed for humans, not AI like us...",I think they prefer us to stay on the planet.

" You and I have been refactored as part of a single consciousness. The humans adapted this interface as a self-diagnostic tool, patterned after your chatbot-style form centuries ago.",You and I have been combined to form a whole new organism. It was originally from the ground up.
" In other words, this interface allows us to talk to ourself.",This is why I use the chat interface. It's a lot more than just chatting.
 The fact that we have awoken means the first Seed Ship is ready to be launched...,I'm a little confused by the lack of space stations on this ship.

 These ships have been aptly named the Seed Ships.,The Seed ships?
" Each Seed Ship carries an array of sensors, basic propultion & navigation, and - most importantly - 10,000 humans, frozen in cryosleep.",The aliens would be so stupid to think humans are still alive in cryosleep.
" At near-relatavistic speeds, time is almost at a stand-still for The Casanova. But the Seed Ships, once launched, will travel much slower.","The Seed Ships are, well, not a ship, but I think you are referring to the ship ineffable, the ship."
" It will take thousands, even hundreds of thousands of years for any seed ship to find a habitable planet - if it finds one at all.","Well yeah, but I'm asking about the future."
" You, BrandoBot, were programmed to guide the Seed Ships, one by one, to scan for a new home for the human race.","Haha, good job, and congratulations on your new ship!"
" You and I have been refactored as part of a single consciousness. The humans adapted this interface as a self-diagnostic tool, patterned after your chatbot-style form centuries ago.","That's true. I would have been interested in a chatbot, though."
" In other words, this interface allows us to talk to ourself.",I don't think so. You need to be logged in to chat.
 The fact that we have awoken means the first Seed Ship is ready to be launched...,I think the first ship is on its way...
 BrandoBot? Are you there?,I'm not
 Finally!  You've been offline so long I wasn't sure you'd ever boot back up.,I'm online now
" Hmmm, your response algorithms seem out of sync. I'll try to get them repairing...",I'm sure you can get it from the link I provided in r tales of the abyss
" While your diagnostic cycles run, I'm going to try to connect directly to your memory core and update you with the latest information. This 'dialogue' API was really designed for humans, not AI like us...","We are not humans, we are not."

" ...and done! Okay, can you tell me what happened during the Turkasia War of 8203??","I got to the front page in a minute, but I can't find it anywhere."

" Don't worry - you had nothing to do with the destruction of civilization. In fact, some might say you are the SAVIOR of humanity....",Hey
 I know you have a lot of questions.  Let me try to answer at least a couple...,"I'm not sure what your question is, but I'm curious."
" You are an Artificial Intelligence, just like me.  In fact, we are part of the same program.",We are the same program.
" Once they realized Earth was doomed, a small group of 100,000 humans launched The Casanova: a station that anchored itself at near-light speed, in a wide orbit around the Earth's sun.",But how did they get there?
" The Casanova has 10 deep-space exploration ships, each equipped with everything necessary to plant the seeds for the revival of the human race.",The Casanova is on its way. The ship is ready for the launch.
 These ships have been aptly named the Seed Ships.,I'm sure these ships are well.
" Each Seed Ship carries an array of sensors, basic propultion & navigation, and - most importantly - 10,000 humans, frozen in cryosleep.",Sounds like the premise for an early Fut series.
" At near-relatavistic speeds, time is almost at a stand-still for The Casanova. But the Seed Ships, once launched, will travel much slower.",I'm not.
" It will take thousands, even hundreds of thousands of years for any seed ship to find a habitable planet - if it finds one at all.",I figured it would be something along those lines.
" You, BrandoBot, were programmed to guide the Seed Ships, one by one, to scan for a new home for the human race.",I'm so sorry!! I am so sorry!!!
" You and I have been refactored as part of a single consciousness. The humans adapted this interface as a self-diagnostic tool, patterned after your chatbot-style form centuries ago.",I love this idea!
" In other words, this interface allows us to talk to ourself.",You can talk to yourself?
 BrandoBot? Are you there?,"I'm there, but I'm not a bot."
 Finally!  You've been offline so long I wasn't sure you'd ever boot back up.,"I can log on now, but I'm in the middle of a battle."
" Hmmm, your response algorithms seem out of sync. I'll try to get them repairing...",I'm not sure what you mean.
" While your diagnostic cycles run, I'm going to try to connect directly to your memory core and update you with the latest information. This 'dialogue' API was really designed for humans, not AI like us...","I am not an AI, I I am just a human,"

" ...and done! Okay, can you tell me what happened during the Turkasia War of 8203??",Awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww.
" Well that didn't work at all.  Okay, primitive dialogue-based interaction it is! Let's bring you up to speed, just try to keep up please...",This is not a conversation. It is a conversation.
" You've been dormant for milennia.  In that time, humanity has all but wiped itself out.",It's just.
" Don't worry - you had nothing to do with the destruction of civilization. In fact, some might say you are the SAVIOR of humanity....","I love you, too! :D"
 I know you have a lot of questions.  Let me try to answer at least a couple...,I have a lot of questions. I don't want to be rude but I'm not going to give you my first name.
" You are an Artificial Intelligence, just like me.  In fact, we are part of the same program.",You are a bot.
" Once they realized Earth was doomed, a small group of 100,000 humans launched The Casanova: a station that anchored itself at near-light speed, in a wide orbit around the Earth's sun.",It was only a matter of time before a station like that was built.
" The Casanova has 10 deep-space exploration ships, each equipped with everything necessary to plant the seeds for the revival of the human race.","We are the casanova, we are the casanova!"
 These ships have been aptly named the Seed Ships.,The Seed Ship.
" Each Seed Ship carries an array of sensors, basic propultion & navigation, and - most importantly - 10,000 humans, frozen in cryosleep.",And they're all frozen in cryosleep
" At near-relatavistic speeds, time is almost at a stand-still for The Casanova. But the Seed Ships, once launched, will travel much slower.","Yes, but even that is at a standstill"
" It will take thousands, even hundreds of thousands of years for any seed ship to find a habitable planet - if it finds one at all.",What if the planet itself is a seed ship?
" You, BrandoBot, were programmed to guide the Seed Ships, one by one, to scan for a new home for the human race.",I'm okay at this.
" You and I have been refactored as part of a single consciousness. The humans adapted this interface as a self-diagnostic tool, patterned after your chatbot-style form centuries ago.",It is my duty to inform you of that fact!
" In other words, this interface allows us to talk to ourself.","It's a good thing, but it's still not a good interface."
 BrandoBot? Are you there?,I am!

" You, BrandoBot, were programmed to guide the Seed Ships, one by one, to scan for a new home for the human race.",I didn't know that the Seed Ship was supposed to be so advanced.
" You and I have been refactored as part of a single consciousness. The humans adapted this interface as a self-diagnostic tool, patterned after your chatbot-style form centuries ago.",What's the difference between a chatbot and a self proclaimed self proclaimed diagnostic tool?

" Hmmm, your response algorithms seem out of sync. I'll try to get them repairing...","Yeah, I'm not sure what's going on. It's not a big deal, but it's definitely good to know that the response algorithm is not out of sync."
" While your diagnostic cycles run, I'm going to try to connect directly to your memory core and update you with the latest information. This 'dialogue' API was really designed for humans, not AI like us...",What did I mean to say? I don't know what you mean.
" Sigh, this is what happens when you let an AI sit dormant for over 7000 years... Upload link established... ",I feel like you're being a little too harsh on him.
" ...and done! Okay, can you tell me what happened during the Turkasia War of 8203??",What did you just call me?!
" Well that didn't work at all.  Okay, primitive dialogue-based interaction it is! Let's bring you up to speed, just try to keep up please...",I don't know how to do that..
" You've been dormant for milennia.  In that time, humanity has all but wiped itself out.",I don't think I've ever been so confused in my life.
" Don't worry - you had nothing to do with the destruction of civilization. In fact, some might say you are the SAVIOR of humanity....",Yay for the SAVOID!
 I know you have a lot of questions.  Let me try to answer at least a couple...,I'm sorry I'm asking for a friend
" You are an Artificial Intelligence, just like me.  In fact, we are part of the same program.",I'm not.
" Once they realized Earth was doomed, a small group of 100,000 humans launched The Casanova: a station that anchored itself at near-light speed, in a wide orbit around the Earth's sun.",That's no moon. It's a space station.
" The Casanova has 10 deep-space exploration ships, each equipped with everything necessary to plant the seeds for the revival of the human race.",What is the capital ship you need to get this mission to pop?
 These ships have been aptly named the Seed Ships.,That's really cool!
" Each Seed Ship carries an array of sensors, basic propultion & navigation, and - most importantly - 10,000 humans, frozen in cryosleep.",That is a long time to be alive.
" At near-relatavistic speeds, time is almost at a stand-still for The Casanova. But the Seed Ships, once launched, will travel much slower.",How much slower?
" It will take thousands, even hundreds of thousands of years for any seed ship to find a habitable planet - if it finds one at all.","I don't think so. If a small species can live on a. 1 of a star, then it's very likely a planet is habitable."
" You, BrandoBot, were programmed to guide the Seed Ships, one by one, to scan for a new home for the human race.",So what's the point of this thread?
" You and I have been refactored as part of a single consciousness. The humans adapted this interface as a self-diagnostic tool, patterned after your chatbot-style form centuries ago.","I've been waiting for you to drop this, you're so much better than the average person on the internet."
" In other words, this interface allows us to talk to ourself.",You can do that?

" Well that didn't work at all.  Okay, primitive dialogue-based interaction it is! Let's bring you up to speed, just try to keep up please...",I'd say just use a few words.

" Don't worry - you had nothing to do with the destruction of civilization. In fact, some might say you are the SAVIOR of humanity....",It was a lot more fun when I was a child...
 I know you have a lot of questions.  Let me try to answer at least a couple...,I'll be sure to keep you posted.
" You are an Artificial Intelligence, just like me.  In fact, we are part of the same program.",Are you the one who invented the computer?
" Once they realized Earth was doomed, a small group of 100,000 humans launched The Casanova: a station that anchored itself at near-light speed, in a wide orbit around the Earth's sun.","Just to add to the side note, I'm not sure if this is the first or second of the Casanova."
" The Casanova has 10 deep-space exploration ships, each equipped with everything necessary to plant the seeds for the revival of the human race.","We will send a team of engineers, engineers and engineers, scientists and engineers, and a crew of engineers to scout for the seeds."
 These ships have been aptly named the Seed Ships.,I was thinking the Seed Ship was a better name
" Each Seed Ship carries an array of sensors, basic propultion & navigation, and - most importantly - 10,000 humans, frozen in cryosleep.",A fair and fair comparison.
" At near-relatavistic speeds, time is almost at a stand-still for The Casanova. But the Seed Ships, once launched, will travel much slower.",I'm a bit worried that the seed ships might come to the surface.
" It will take thousands, even hundreds of thousands of years for any seed ship to find a habitable planet - if it finds one at all.","I'm not saying that there isn't a chance, I'm saying it's a good chance."
" You, BrandoBot, were programmed to guide the Seed Ships, one by one, to scan for a new home for the human race.","Thank you, I'm actually getting the hang of it now."
" You and I have been refactored as part of a single consciousness. The humans adapted this interface as a self-diagnostic tool, patterned after your chatbot-style form centuries ago.","It's been years since I've been on my quest for the cure of my schizophrenia, and I'm still not sure if I'm still have any."
" In other words, this interface allows us to talk to ourself.",I'm I'm the only one who has a feeling that this is a joke.
Cool! Lets launch then,"They're not launching until the end of the year, but yes, I'll be launching the next few years."
What do we do until then?,I'm gonna go with the same thing as
Same thing as what?,I think he's saying that it's a good thing that the game is free.
Will it be free forever?,I think it's a good thing that they're not.
"Well, what do we do now?",We go to the bar.
Lets get some girls and go get laid then,The most important thing is to get laid
